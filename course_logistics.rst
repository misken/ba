Textbook and software
=====================

Please see Moodle for textbook information.

Software Overview
-----------------

Microsoft Excel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will use MS Excel 2016/2019/365 extensively in this course. The SBA computer labs all have Excel 2019. If you have either Excel 365, 2019 or 2016 on your personal computer, you should be fine. 

**Important Note regarding Office for the Mac**: Unfortunately, MS has simply not made Excel for the Mac into the product it needs to be. There are add-ins we'll be using in this class as well as lots of VBA code that make it very difficult (and sometimes, impossible) for Mac versions of Excel to be used.

Another option for accessing a Windows version of Excel is to use OU's Apporto Virtual Lab. See https://www.oakland.edu/uts/common-good-core-resources/virtual-labs/ for details. I also posted a screencast and additional links in Moodle regarding Apporto in the Additional Software Resources section.


Textbook files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Both of the textbooks we use ship with a number of student files associated with examples, problems, cases, etc. These will all be available on our Moodle site within the Textbook and Software section.

Palisade Decision Tools Suite
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is the primary Excel add-in that we will use. Palisade adds a ton of great business analytics functionality to Excel including simulation (@Risk), optimization, and data mining. Detailed instructions for obtaining and installing the Palisade Decision Tools Suite will be made available. We will NOT need this software for several weeks. 

Tableau
^^^^^^^

This is a widely used data pivoting, exploration and visualization tool. You can get a free student copy through the SBA. 

Get Tableau (free academic license) - see Moodle.
