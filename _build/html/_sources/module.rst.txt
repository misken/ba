Digital elevation map of the Grand Canyon using Excel
-----------------------------------------------------

In this class we explore all kinds of strange uses of Excel. For example, currently I'm teaching myself how to create agent based simulation models with a free package called NetLogo (http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). It involves simulations that play out on a grid (yes, much like a spreadsheet). I was goofing around with a model of rainfall in the Grand Canyon and wanted to see what would happen if I imported digital elevation data into Excel and used Conditional Formatting to try to create a digital elevation map. It works, but the aspect ratio is messed up unless you get the cells to be perfect squares. That led me to this cool link: http://www.mrexcel.com/tip071.shtml. Finally, I got it to work and made a digital elevation model (DEM) of a little piece of the Grand Canyon in Excel.
