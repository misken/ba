Organizing your data 
***********************************

Intro and Objectives
====================

We often work with tabular data in spreadsheets - it's kind of what spreadsheets were designed for. There are some data organization principles that can help you organize tabular data in a way that:

- makes it easier to analyze 
- helps avoid errors
- makes it easier to share with collaborators
- makes it easier to move between other analysis tools (e.g. Tableau, R, Python)
- makes you a better Excel user
- makes you a better analyst


Readings
========

The following blog post does a terrific job of articulating important 
spreadsheet organization principles. The post led to a journal article
in The American Statistician. You can find a PDF of the journal article
at the link below (and in the Downloads file).

* Original blog post - https://kbroman.org/dataorg/
* Subsequent journal article - https://kbroman.org/Paper_DataOrg/manuscript.pdf

In addition, the folks at Data Carpentry have a freely accessible tutorial
on spreadsheet organization principles that they aimed at ecologists. Many
good tips to be found here.

Activities

In the Downloads file you'll find a subfolder named **DataOrgPrinciples**. Within there
you'll find a file named **DataOrg.xlsm**. Get that file open and this series of
screencasts will cover some important data organization principles using this file.

We'll start with an overview of the data org blog post by Broman and an intro to the
file I've created to illustrate some of the important data org principles.

Let's learn about *tidy data* and also explore doing some computations with that data.

What's the difference between wide and long data? How do we reshape data to get it
into the form we need for analysis?

* `SCREENCAST: Data reshaping (12:32) <https://youtu.be/WJHYyOlqbBY>`_

What to do about missing data? What is #N/A?

* `SCREENCAST: Missing data (12:04) <https://youtu.be/qOn-2Z3S8c8>`_

Dates - you really need to be careful with date formats, especially when sharing data.
We've already learned how Excel stores dates as integers (or "serial values"). There's 
more chapters to this story.

I highly encourage you to read through the entire blog post by Broman. Much wisdom
in there.
