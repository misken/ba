Resource Center
===============

Here are links to a variety of business analytics and Excel related resources.

General business analytics
------------------------------------------------

* `Analytics Magazine`_ It's published by `INFORMS - the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science <https://www.informs.org/>`_. They are the premier professional society for analytics and it's inexpensive to join as a student. Full disclosure, I've been an INFORMS member since about 1986 (when it was still ORSA/TIMS). We were doing analytics before it was called analytics. :)
* `Competing on Analytics`_ - This is the Harvard Business Review article that brought analytics to the forefront in business (even though it had been around for decades). The article led to a book of the same name that was a best seller in the business world.

Excel resources
-----------------

Tons of Excel resources exist on the web. Here are a few.

Blogs and metasites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Excel modeling and analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Albright, Winston Textbooks`_ - I'm a longtime user of several of these guys textbooks. This page contains numerous files related to their books. Great stuff - also check out the `Free Downloads page <https://host.kelley.iu.edu/albrightbooks/Free_downloads.htm>`_. 
* `ModelOff`_ - Financial modeling world championships. Must see to believe. But..., things have changed. Even though this link now leads to a commercial set of learning resources, I'm leaving it here because it's an interesting statement on the evolution of modeling in the finance world. You can find some of the `classic ModelOff competitions on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=modeloff+financial+modeling+world+championships>`_.
