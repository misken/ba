Resource Center
===============

Here are links to a variety of business analytics and Excel related resources.

General business analytics
------------------------------------------------

* `Analytics Magazine`_ It's published by `INFORMS - the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science <https://www.informs.org/>`_. They are the premier professional society for analytics and it's inexpensive to join as a student. Full disclosure, I've been an INFORMS member since about 1986 (when it was still ORSA/TIMS). We were doing analytics before it was called analytics. :)
* `Competing on Analytics`_ - This is the Harvard Business Review article that brought analytics to the forefront in business (even though it had been around for decades). The article led to a book of the same name that was a best seller in the business world.

Excel resources
-----------------

Tons of Excel resources exist on the web. Here are a few.

Blogs and metasites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `ExcelIsFun`_ - Huge You Tube channel of Excel how-to videos
* `ExcelJet <https://exceljet.net/>`_ - Excel learning resources (some free, some not)
* `Excel Help, Resources and Tutorials`_ - Good collection of organized links including a list of Best Books for Learning Excel. Found out about this one in the Excel Developers LinkedIn group.
* `Daily Dose of Excel`_ - blog posts by various Excel folks
* `Peltier Tech Blog`_ - longtime Excel blogger
* `Top 69 Blogs in the World for Learning Excel`_ - nice list with good descriptions

Excel modeling and analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `Albright, Winston Textbooks`_ - I'm a longtime user of several of these guys textbooks. This page contains numerous files related to their books. Great stuff - also check out the `Free Downloads page <https://host.kelley.iu.edu/albrightbooks/Free_downloads.htm>`_. 
* `ModelOff`_ - Financial modeling world championships. Must see to believe. But..., things have changed. Even though this link now leads to a commercial set of learning resources, I'm leaving it here because it's an interesting statement on the evolution of modeling in the finance world. You can find some of the `classic ModelOff competitions on YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=modeloff+financial+modeling+world+championships>`_.


Communities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* `StackOverflow Excel tags`_ - excel, excel-vba, excel-formulas, more...
* `Mr. Excel`_ - Community message board, blog, consulting services and more
